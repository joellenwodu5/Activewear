Dropshipping is a business model in which an online retailer (the dropshipper) sells products to customers without stocking or handling the inventory. Instead, when a customer places an order, the dropshipper purchases the products directly from a third-party supplier or manufacturer, who then ships the products directly to the customer's doorstep.

Here's how the dropshipping process typically works:
The dropshipper sets up an online store or website, showcasing products from various suppliers or manufacturers. The dropshipper may also choose to list these products on e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Aliexpress, or Amazon.
A customer visits the dropshipper's online store and places an order for a product.
The dropshipper receives the order and payment from the customer. They then forward the order details and payment to the supplier or manufacturer, usually through an automated system or manually by contacting the supplier.
The supplier or manufacturer prepares the order, packages the products, and ships them directly to the customer. The package usually contains the dropshipper's branding and contact information instead of the supplier's.
The customer receives the order directly from the supplier, without any indication that it was fulfilled through dropshipping.
In this model, the dropshipper acts as an intermediary between the customer and the supplier, handling the marketing, customer service, and order processing. The dropshipper earns a profit by selling the products at a higher price than the wholesale price they pay to the supplier.

Dropshipping offers several advantages to entrepreneurs:
Low startup costs: Since the dropshipper doesn't need to purchase inventory upfront, they can start an online business with minimal financial investment.
No inventory management: The dropshipper doesn't need to handle or store inventory. This eliminates the need for warehouse space, reducing operational costs and complexity.
Wide product selection: Dropshipping allows for a wide range of products to be offered without the need to physically stock them. The dropshipper can choose from numerous suppliers or manufacturers and offer diverse product options to customers.
Flexibility and scalability: Dropshipping businesses can easily scale up or down based on demand, as they are not limited by inventory. This flexibility allows for quick expansion or adjustment of the product catalog.
